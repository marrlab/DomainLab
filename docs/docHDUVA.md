# HDUVA: HIERARCHICAL VARIATIONAL AUTO-ENCODING FOR UNSUPERVISED DOMAIN GENERALIZATION

HDUVA builds on a generative approach within the framework of variational autoencoders to facilitate generalization to new domains without supervision. HDUVA learns representations that disentangle domain-specific information from class-label specific information even in complex settings where domain structure is not observed during training.
