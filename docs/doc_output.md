# Output structure
By default, this package(library) generate outputs to a folder called "zoutput" relative to the current working directory. The structure is something similar as follows. ([] means the folder might or might not exist)

```
zoutput/
├── aggrsts (aggregation of results)
│   ├── task1_test_domain1_tagName.csv
│   ├── task2_test_domain3_tagName.csv
│   
│  
├── [gen] (counterfactual image generation, only exist for generative models)
│   ├── [task1_test_domain1]
│   
└── saved_models (persisted pytorch model)
    ├── task1_algo1_git-commit-hashtag1_seed_1_instance_wise_predictions.txt (instance wise prediction of the model)
    ├── [task1_algo1_git-commit-hashtag1_seed_1.model]  (only exist if with command line argument "--keep_model")
    ├── [task1_algo1_git-commit-hashtag1_seed_1.model_oracle]
```

"aggrst" folder is aggregating results from several runs corresponding to the same train test split of the identical task, that means after each run, an extra line will be appended to the file corresponding to the same train test split of the identical task, so that it is convenient to compare between different algorithms and configurations upon the same train test split of the identical task.

"saved_models" folder contains instance wise prediction in a text file for each run, and potentially the persisted model on the hard disk (by default, these models will be deleted after run is completed)

# Computing performances
The user is responsible to generate performance measures by reading from the instance wise prediction files from "saved_models" folder as above.
