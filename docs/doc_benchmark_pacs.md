## Let DomainLab know where your PACS data were located
We define the diretory containing PACS  data here [relative directory of PACS dataset with respect to the DomainLab repository](https://github.com/marrlab/DomainLab/blob/70ce95c8093ffec0f4b63734d06d2521815a9da7/examples/tasks/task_pacs_path_list.py#L13)
To avoid changing the code, which is always discouraged, one could make a symbolic link of your PACS dataset to the required directory in the code above [see examples here](https://github.com/marrlab/DomainLab/blob/master/sh_pacs.sh)
