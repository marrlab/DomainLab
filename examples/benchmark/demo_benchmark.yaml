# list of all domains that are used as test domain
# in a leave-one-out setup, i.e. for each run,
# one domain from this list is chosen as test domain
# while training is performed on all other domains
# of the specified dataset.

  - caltech

# number of hyperparameter samples per task.
# Thus, the total runs of each task are given
# by len(test_domains) * num_param_samples * num_seeds (see below)
num_param_samples: 2
# sets the seed for hyperparameter sampling.
# With this option and the experiment seeds from
# startseed and endseed, this benchmark is fully reproducible.
sampling_seed: 1  # Optional

# the seed is increased by +1 until it reaches endseed.
# endseed is included, so in total startseed - endseed + 1
# different seeds are used to estimate the stochastic
# variance.

  hyperparameters:
    # Each parameter must contain:
    # - distribution (uniform | loguniform | normal | lognormal)
    # - min and max if distribution is uniform or loguniform
    # - mean and std if distribution is normal or lognormal

    # step is optional and defines discrete parameters
    # with the given step size.
    # If min/mean and step are integer valued,
    # the hyperparameter is ensured to be integer valued too.
    # Otherwise, it is a float and rounding errors can occur.
